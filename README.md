# Analog-to-digital-conversion-Process
One of the aims of this laboratory was to learn some of the fundamentals of Matlab such as data entry, plotting, and data handling as well as how to create a continuous time signal and then sample the continuous time signal to produce a discrete time signal. In addition, the discrete time signal was fixed in intervals of time, but its magnitude was continuous (it could adopt any value at all). Furthermore, it has been tried to apply quantisation to the discrete signal to produce a discrete signal which is fixed in time and fixed in predetermined levels of magnitude to produce a digital signal. Also it has been used a variety of interpolation techniques to ‘fill in’ the missing data due to the sampling process which allow to go from a continuous time signal, to a discrete time signal, and then back to a continuous time signal.
